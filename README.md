Investors construct portfolios by allocating capital across multiple assets. One common strategy is equal-weight allocation, where each asset receives the same proportion of investment. Another approach is custom-weight allocation, where different weights are assigned based on investor preference or conviction.

However, these allocation strategies may result in significantly different risk-return characteristics.

This project aims to build a Portfolio Performance Comparison Engine that:

Computes and compares portfolio returns under equal-weight and custom-weight strategies.

Evaluates portfolio performance using financial metrics such as cumulative return, volatility, Sharpe ratio, and maximum drawdown.

Provides analytical insights into risk-return trade-offs between different allocation strategies.

The system processes historical stock price data, calculates daily returns, constructs portfolios, and performs comparative performance analysis.
